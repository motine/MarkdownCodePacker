# Markdown Code Packer

## Motivation

I often want to save code files in my markdown notes, but they disrupt the reading flow.
Sometimes I just want to include them if I ever want to reproduce the spike project.
Sometimes I create gist.

## Sublime Plugin

- How does it work?

- Unpack
- Pack
- select multiple lines/code blocks to pack/unpack them at same time

## Installation

- With Package Control: Open the command palette and run the `Package Control: Install Package` command, find and install the `Markdown Code Packer` plugin.
- Manually: Clone or download git repository into your packages folder (to find the folder run the command `Preferences - Browse Packages`).

## Choices

- why use comments?
- why use deflate and base64?
